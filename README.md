# Clarkson Rotated Fingerprint segmentation (CRFSEG) system 
This repo contains code to run the CRFSEG (Clarkson Rotated Fingerprint Segmentation) model to segment slap fingerprint images

## Pre-trained model
* A pre-trained model is stored in the trained_model folder.

## Test images 
* A few test images are stored in the test_image folder to test the model.

## How to run the pre-trained model on an image
* The CRFSEG.ipynb file contains the necessary code to run the model. 
* Run Jupiter notebook on your computer and execute the code inside CRFSEG.ipynb file.
* The final cell of the notebook code will show the output images containing the labels and bounding boxes around the fingerprints.
